                  <p>So, you&rsquo;re probably wondering where I'm heading to. well, I am headed to Minnoush Michigan! Yoopers shay hello!&nbsp; This wonderful 1600-person city is right on Lake Michigan, in the heart of the rust belt.&nbsp; On their website it says that the city &ldquo;has a lively downtown, friendly people, and a large nature preserve.&rdquo; apparently they have at least some tourist passing though because there are a handful of hotels in the area. mostly single night motels but I was able to find a bed and breakfast within my budget, it looks lovely from the pictures, apparently it was once a townhouse that the owner has changed to be a BnB. It is called Gilman House, and here is its website.</p>
                 <!-- //link to a fake website? small Hover gag -->
                  <p>This town called to me when I read about the recent shutting down of its largest factory during the 2008 recession.&nbsp; It was hit hard outside of that, with the town being hit hard by the past winters and a large exodus with the closing of the factory. &nbsp;Though recently it has been hit with the urban explorer craze and is leaning into that along with improving its public areas, namely its large game reserve. &nbsp;Though I'm not going to be doing any hunting there are nature trails throughout the park along with tours.</p>
                  <p>Thank you to <a href = https://https://juussttmeeee.tumblr.com>Juussttmeeee</a> for bringing this wonderful town to my attention.  I cannot wait to explore it! also, feel free to dm me so we can get some drinks while I'm here!</p>
                  <p>Anyway, this is day 0, there will be another post or two as long as the bus&rsquo;s wifi holds out.&nbsp; see you soon!</p>

                  <p>Haha, he&rsquo;s a really cool guy we during the stopover in Oldburry we had a nice chat. He was born and raised in Minnosh. He was able to tell me about the town&rsquo;s history. Apparently, it was some sort of fishing town before the factory, and some local businesses are trying to bring fishing back as a new income source. Which I think is super rad! The lake trout and whitefish are some of the best natural recourses from this area, and I cannot wait to see what these guys are bringing in!</p>
